\chapter{The Cross and Resurrection of Christ}


Note that your construct is what determines how you interpret the visions, thus since the constructs are of human origin, we must always challenge them to make sure they line up with scripture.  Do not so tightly hold to a construct that you bend the text to meet it.  Let's look at some prophesies with interpretations to see how this works.  Read Daniel 7:1-14.  What do you think it means?  Read Daniel 7: 15-28.  How close were you? Now Read Daniel 8:1-14.  So what do you think this means?  Now Read Daniel 8:15-27.  How did this square with history?  Note: if you ever want a great way to show the truth of the scriptures look at how prophesy in the Scriptures are fulfilled, like the exacting details in Daniel 11:2-35, which reads like a history book without the names.
